        <h1>Battle of Montagisard</h1>
        <p>The Battle of Montgisard was fought between the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Ayyubid Dynasty on 25 November 1177 at Montgisard,<br> in the Levant between Ramla and Yibna. The 16-year-old Baldwin IV of Jerusalem,<br> severely afflicted by leprosy, led outnumbered Christian forces against Saladin's troops in what became one of the most notable engagements of the Crusades.<br> The Muslim Army was quickly routed and pursued for twelve miles. Saladin fled back to Cairo, reaching the city on 8 December, with only a tenth of his army.<br> Muslim historians considered Saladin's defeat to be so severe that it was only redeemed by his victory ten years later at the battles of Cresson and Hattin and<br> the Siege of Jerusalem in 1187. Saladin did defeat Baldwin IV in the Battle of Marj Ayyun and the Siege of Jacobs Ford in 1179, only to be defeated by Baldwin again at the Battle of Belvoir<br> Castle in 1182 and the Siege of Kerak in 1183.</p>

        <p>In 1177, King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, and Philip of Alsace who had recently arrived on pilgrimage, planned an alliance<br> with the Byzantine Empire for a naval attack on Egypt; but none of these plans came to fruition.</p>
  
        <p>Instead, Philip decided to join Raymond III of Tripolis expedition to attack the Saracen stronghold of Harim in northern Syria.<br> A large Crusader army, the Knights Hospitaller and many Knights Templar followed him.<br> This left the Kingdom of Jerusalem with few troops to defend its various territories. Meanwhile, Saladin was planning his own invasion of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from Egypt.</p>


        <h2>My opinion </h2>
