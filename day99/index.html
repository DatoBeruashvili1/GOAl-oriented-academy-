        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Information transfer between programs begins with user interaction. When a user performs an action, data is sent to the server for processing. The server responds with the necessary information, allowing the program to update its interface and provide the user with timely feedback. This process enhances the overall user experience.
